. what does programming mean?
(دردشة سوا):
Programming means giving instructions to the computer to do tasks.
It's like telling a very fast and accurate worker what to do step by step.


---

. what is the binary code?

1 = electricity (on)

0 = no electricity (off)

It consists of only two digits: 0 and 1

Computers understand binary to process and store data



---

. what is the internet?

It's a global network that connects millions of computers together

Allows sharing of information, files, and communication



---

. how does the internet work?

Your device connects to a router

The router connects to your ISP (Internet Service Provider)

Then it reaches servers that store the data you request

Data travels in small packets across different paths and gets reassembled when it arrives



---

. what is python?

A high-level programming language that can do almost anything

Free and open-source

Interpreted (runs line by line)

Interactive (you can test code directly)



---

. why python?

Easy to install and learn

Clean and readable syntax

Error handling is simple

Easy debugging (Python has its own debugger)

Cross-platform (works on Windows, macOS, Linux)

Expressive and powerful

Object-Oriented Programming support

Integrated easily with other languages/tools

Supports modules and packages

Large library and plugin support

Memory management via Garbage Collection

Multi-purpose: Web, AI, Data Science, Automation...

Great and active community

Growing very fast

You can even switch careers with just Python basics

. the command line (cmd)

Used to install Python

Install libraries and packages

Create and activate virtual environments

Run Python servers (e.g., Flask, Django)

Create new projects

Open them in VS Code

Check for errors

Navigate the file system and folders

. comments in python

Single line comment: # your comment here

Multi-line documentation/comment:

"""
Your multi-line comment
"""



---

. data types

str – string (text)

int – integer (whole numbers)

float – decimal numbers

bool – boolean (True/False)

list – a group of items

var – (معلومة: في بايثون مفيش حاجة اسمها var، لكن المتغير بيتكتب كده: x = 5)



---

. type casting

Means converting from one data type to another

Example:

int("5")  # turns string "5" into number 5



---

. if condition

Used to control the flow of code

Syntax:

if condition:
    # do something
elif another_condition:
    # do something else
else:
    # fallback



---

. loops

Used to repeat code

for loop

while loop

Example:

for i in range(5):
    print(i)

while condition:
    # keep doing this



---

. lists

Contains multiple items

Example:

my_list = [1, 2, 3, "hello", True]



---

. functions

Reusable blocks of code

Syntax:

def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")



---

. numpy (introduction)

A library used for mathematical operations and arrays

Useful in data science and AI

Example:

import numpy as np
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3])



---

. module

A file that contains Python code (functions, variables...)

You can import it into another file

Example:

import math
print(math.sqrt(16))



---

. OOP (inheritance only)

Object-Oriented Programming allows code reusability

Inheritance means a class can use features from another class

Example:

class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        print("Sound")

class Dog(Animal):
    pass

d = Dog()
d.speak()  # Output: Sound
